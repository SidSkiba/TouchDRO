TocuhDRO PCB Kicad Design

PCB Design Files for a DIY TouchDRO PCB. This is based on information provided by https://www.touchdro.com/

All design done in Kicad 8.

Firmware files provided by https://www.touchdro.com/

All Gerber files included for JLCPCB to manufacture the circuit boards.

Design uses some surface mount components (some 0805 sized resistors and capacitors and sirface mount IC's) so you need to be comfortable with soldering those devices to the board.

Note that ESP32 module needs to be spaced 5mm above the circuit board.
